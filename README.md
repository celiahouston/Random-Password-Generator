# Random-Password-Generator

In this challenge I created a webpage that generates a random password based on specific user criteria. The webpage uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. The HTML and CSS create a user friendly interface. I used alerts to make the generating of the password simple and straight forward. I also used if/else statements to ensure the password criteria would be met. 

The webpage presents a series of prompts for password criteria:

Length of password: At least 8 characters but no more than 128.

Character types: Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric, Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password is logged in the console.
